# **Overview**  

In the development of this repo, we aim to include all facets of **kernel hardening**, **penetration testing**, and **OS security** for Debian Linux systems, ensuring both security and stability.

We will always take suggestions and mentioning of how to keep Linux secure and productivity high. 

This document outlines the pre-release activities that need to be completed before finalizing the project release.

These tasks are designed to reinforce security, improve performance, and streamline user management.

By following these guidelines, you will enhance system security, maintain stability, and optimize Debian-based systems for performance and resilience.
