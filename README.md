</p>

## Quick Start

## Download and Install

```bash
wget https://github.com/OpenSource-For-Freedom/HARDN-XDR/releases/download/v1.1.97/hardn_1.1.97_amd64.deb
sudo apt install ./hardn_1.1.97_amd64.deb
sudo hardn-xdr
---

#### Option 2: Build from Source

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/OpenSource-For-Freedom/HARDN-XDR
cd HARDN-XDR
```

2. Build the package:

```bash
dpkg-buildpackage -us -uc
```

3. Install the generated `.deb`:

```bash
sudo apt install ../hardn_1.1.94_amd64.deb
```

---

### Run the Program

Launch the HARDN-XDR interactive interface:

```bash
sudo hardn-xdr
```

For detailed info and command-line options, consult the man page:

```bash
man hardn-xdr
```
---

### How the Interactive Menu Works
The interactive menu is the core of the `HARDN-XDR` script's flexibility, and it's powered by a standard Linux utility called `whiptail`. Here’s a breakdown of how it works inside the `setup_security` function in `hardn-main.sh`:

#### 1. Defining the Menu Items
First, a Bash array called `modules` is created. This array holds the definition for every single item that appears in the checklist menu. Each item consists of three parts:
- **The script filename**: e.g., `"ufw.sh"`
- **A user-friendly description**: e.g., `"Configure UFW Firewall"`
- **The default state**: `ON` (checked by default) or `OFF` (unchecked by default)

```bash
local modules=(
    "ufw.sh" "Configure UFW Firewall" ON
    "fail2ban.sh" "Install and configure Fail2Ban" ON
    "pentest.sh" "Install penetration testing tools" OFF
    # ... and so on
)
```

#### 2. Displaying the Menu
Next, the `whiptail` command is called with the `--checklist` option. It's given the title, the instructional text, and the `modules` array. `whiptail` then draws the interactive menu on the screen. When the user clicks "Ok", `whiptail` prints their selected choices as a string, which is captured in a variable.

```bash
choices=$(whiptail --title "HARDN-XDR Security Modules" --checklist \
    "Choose which security modules to apply:" 25 85 18 \
    "${modules[@]}" 3>&1 1>&2 2>&3)
```

#### 3. Executing the Selected Modules
Finally, the script loops through the user's choices. For each choice, it constructs the full path to the module script (e.g., `./modules/ufw.sh`), checks if the file exists, and then executes it using the `source` command.

```bash
for choice in $choices; do
    # ...
    local module_path="./modules/${choice//\"/}"
    if [ -f "$module_path" ]; then
        source "$module_path"
    fi
done
```
This approach makes the system very modular and easy to extend. To add a new hardening option, all that's needed is to create the new module script and add a corresponding entry to the `modules` array in `hardn-main.sh`.

### Installation Notes
- HARDN-XDR is currently being developed and tested for **BARE-METAL installs of Debian based distributions and Virtual Machines**.
- Ensure you have the latest version of **Debian 12**.
- By installing HARDN-XDR with the command listed in the installation, the following changes will be made to your system:
> - A collection of security focused packages will be installed.
> - Security tools and services will be enabled.
> - System hardening and STIG settings will be applied.
> - A malware and signature detection and response system will be set up.
> - A monitoring and reporting system will be activated. 
- For a detailed list of all that will be changed, please refer to [HARDN.md](docs/HARDN.md).
- For an overview of HARDN-Debian STIG Compliance, please refer to [deb_stig.md](docs/deb_stig.md).
