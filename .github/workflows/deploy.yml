# This file has been replaced by pages.yml to consolidate GitHub Pages deployment
# and resolve conflicts with the insights workflow.
# 
# The new unified workflow handles both:
# 1. Next.js site building and deployment 
# 2. Traffic badge generation
#
# This file is kept temporarily for reference and will be removed after
# the new workflow is confirmed working.

# Original content moved to pages.yml
