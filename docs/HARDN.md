![HARDN-XDR Logo]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/assets/sig_logo.png)

HARDN-XDR is a comprehensive security hardening and Extended Detection and Response (XDR) framework designed specifically for Linux systems. It provides automated security configuration, continuous monitoring, and advanced threat detection capabilities.

## What is HARDN-XDR?

HARDN-XDR combines traditional system hardening techniques with modern Extended Detection and Response (XDR) capabilities to create a unified security platform that:

- **Hardens** system configurations against known vulnerabilities
- **Detects** suspicious activities and potential threats
- **Responds** to security incidents automatically
- **Reports** security events and compliance status

## Key Components

### 1. System Hardening Engine
- Automated security configuration
- Compliance with industry standards (CIS, STIG, etc.)
- Kernel security enhancements
- Service hardening and access controls

### 2. Detection & Monitoring
- Real-time file integrity monitoring
- Network traffic analysis
- Process and user behavior monitoring
- Log correlation and analysis

### 3. Response & Mitigation
- Automated threat containment
- Incident response workflows
- Alert generation and notification
- Forensic data collection

### 4. Reporting & Compliance
- Security posture dashboards
- Compliance reporting
- Audit trail generation
- Risk assessment metrics
