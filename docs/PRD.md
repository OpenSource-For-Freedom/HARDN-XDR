# Product Requirements Document (PRD)
## HARDN-XDR: Linux Hardening & Extended Detection and Response Platform

---

### 1. Purpose
HARDN-XDR exists to make Linux systems safer out of the box.  
It combines **system hardening, compliance enforcement, and runtime detection** into a single framework that can be deployed on servers, desktops, containers, or virtual machines.

Our mission is simple: reduce attack surface, enforce best practices, and provide visibility into system integrity — without burdening operators with complex setup.

---

### 2. Goals
- **Harden the OS**: Apply CIS/STIG-aligned configuration baselines automatically.  
- **Cross-platform support**: Run on Debian, Ubuntu, pakOS, and eventually Fedora, RHEL, Arch.  
- **Lightweight footprint**: No heavy agents or bloated dependencies.  
- **Detection & response**: Integrate with Suricata, AppArmor, AIDE, and logging backends.  
- **Automated compliance checks**: Run Lynis + OpenSCAP audits in CI/CD for every release.  
- **Ease of deployment**: Package as `.deb` and `.rpm` for straightforward installs.  

---

### 3. Non-Goals
- Not a full SIEM or centralized SOC platform.  
- Not intended to replace EDR vendors for enterprise detection.  
- Not a compliance certification — it enforces baselines but does not issue formal certificates.  

---

### 4. Requirements

#### Functional
1. **Core Hardening Modules**
   - Firewall configuration (UFW, nftables, iptables).  
   - Secure bootloader and GRUB settings.  
   - File integrity monitoring via AIDE.  
   - IDS/IPS integration (Suricata).  
   - Kernel hardening parameters.  
   - AppArmor/SELinux policy enforcement.  

2. **Packaging & Distribution**
   - Debian and Ubuntu packages (`.deb`).  
   - Build pipeline for ARM64 and AMD64.  
   - Cross-distro support through modular scripts.  

3. **CI/CD & Quality Gates**
   - Build and test packages automatically on pushes/PRs.  
   - Run CIS Benchmark workflow (VM-based audits).  
   - Fail builds if hardening score < defined threshold.  
   - Upload artifacts (reports, logs) for traceability.  

4. **Observability**
   - Logging to syslog/journal.  
   - Optional integration to external SIEMs (Elastic, Splunk).  
   - Security status reporting via CLI.  

#### Non-Functional
- **Performance**: Overhead must remain minimal (<5% CPU/RAM).  
- **Portability**: Work identically on bare metal, VMs, and containers.  
- **Usability**: Clear CLI interface with interactive setup (skipped in CI).  
- **Security**: No unnecessary dependencies; minimal attack surface in codebase.  

---

### 5. User Stories
- *As a sysadmin*, I want my servers hardened automatically so I don’t miss critical settings.  
- *As a developer*, I want every PR tested against CIS benchmarks so regressions are caught early.  
- *As a security engineer*, I want system integrity monitored and logs sent to my SIEM.  
- *As a compliance officer*, I want artifacts proving that baselines were applied.  

---

### 6. Acceptance Criteria
- Hardened Debian/Ubuntu systems with modules applied on install.  
- Suricata and AIDE installed and configured as part of baseline.  
- CI/CD builds produce `.deb` artifacts for multiple architectures.  
- CIS Benchmark workflow runs real VM installs for validation.  
- Lynis and OpenSCAP reports are uploaded for every run.  
- Build fails if Lynis score < 80.  

---

### 7. Risks & Mitigations
- **Risk:** OS variations may break modules.  
  - *Mitigation:* modular structure with detection logic per package manager.  
- **Risk:** No `/dev/kvm` on runner → slow VM audits.  
  - *Mitigation:* fall back to software emulation (slower but functional).  
- **Risk:** False sense of compliance.  
  - *Mitigation:* clearly document scope (CIS/STIG enforcement, not certification).  
- **Risk:** Complexity creep.  
  - *Mitigation:* maintain strict module boundaries, keep core lean.  

---

### 8. Future Enhancements
- Add Fedora, Arch, and RHEL-based OS support.  
- Provide interactive TUI for configuration management.  
- Build score dashboards with trends over time.  
- Integrate container scanning and Kubernetes hardening.  
- Map OpenSCAP results to STIG/DoD baselines.  

---

### 9. Success Metrics
- Automated builds pass/fail based on security posture.  
- At least 80% Lynis hardening score across supported OS targets.  
- Security reports available for all releases.  
- Reduced manual configuration by sysadmins.  
- Positive adoption by community for simplicity and reliability.  

---

### 10. Summary
HARDN-XDR turns hardening and compliance into a **repeatable, automated, and transparent process**.  
By shipping with built-in modules, packaging, and audits, it provides both **practical protection** and **proof of posture**.
