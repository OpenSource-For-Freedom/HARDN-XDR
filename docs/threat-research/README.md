### UNC2891 Research Spike

A comprehensive research spike investigating the UNC2891 threat actor and their impact on endpoint security:

- **[UNC2891-research-spike.md](UNC2891-research-spike.md)**: Complete threat analysis and research findings
- **[UNC2891-gap-analysis.md](UNC2891-gap-analysis.md)**: Detailed security gap analysis mapping UNC2891 TTPs against current HARDN-XDR controls
- **[UNC2891-spike-summary.md](UNC2891-spike-summary.md)**: Executive summary with key findings and recommendations

## Research Methodology

Our threat research follows a structured approach:

1. **Threat Intelligence Gathering**: Collection and analysis of threat actor information
2. **TTP Mapping**: Mapping tactics, techniques, and procedures to MITRE ATT&CK framework
3. **Coverage Analysis**: Evaluating current security controls against identified threats
4. **Gap Identification**: Identifying security gaps and enhancement opportunities
5. **Proof of Concept**: Developing working examples of proposed enhancements

## Key Findings Summary

### UNC2891 Research Results
- **65%** current coverage of relevant MITRE ATT&CK techniques
- **5** critical security gaps identified
- **12** medium-risk gaps requiring attention
- **Proof-of-concept** behavioral monitoring module developed

### Recommended Enhancements
1. Advanced Process Protection Module
2. Enhanced Credential Security Module
3. Behavioral Anomaly Detection Module
4. Network Behavior Analysis Enhancement
5. Advanced Persistence Detection Module

## Implementation Status

| Enhancement | Priority | Status | Timeline |
