## Current HARDN-XDR Controls Analysis

### Existing Controls That Address UNC2891 TTPs

#### Network Security
- **UFW Firewall**: Blocks unauthorized outbound connections, limiting C2 communication
- **Fail2Ban**: Prevents brute force attacks on SSH and other services
- **Network Protocol Hardening**: Disables unnecessary protocols, reduces attack surface

#### System Hardening
- **File Permissions**: Prevents unauthorized access to sensitive system files
- **USB/Firewire Disabling**: Blocks potential lateral movement via removable media
- **Compiler Removal**: Prevents on-the-fly malware compilation
- **Core Dump Disabling**: Prevents credential exposure through memory dumps

#### Access Controls
- **SSH Hardening**: Secures remote access vectors
- **Password Complexity**: Enforces strong authentication (STIG compliant)
- **Account Lockout**: Limits brute force attempts
- **AppArmor/SELinux**: Provides mandatory access controls

#### Monitoring and Detection
- **AIDE**: File integrity monitoring to detect unauthorized changes
- **YARA**: Pattern-based malware detection
- **Suricata**: Network intrusion detection
- **Auditd**: System call auditing for forensic analysis
- **Rkhunter/Chkrootkit**: Rootkit detection

#### Incident Response
- **Automated Updates**: Keeps systems patched against known vulnerabilities
- **Central Logging**: Aggregates security events for analysis
- **Process Accounting**: Tracks process execution for forensics

### Identified Security Gaps

#### 1. Advanced Persistence Mechanisms
**Gap**: Limited detection of advanced persistence techniques
**Recommendation**: Enhanced boot process monitoring and verification

#### 2. Memory-Based Attacks
**Gap**: Insufficient protection against fileless malware and process injection
**Recommendation**: Runtime application self-protection (RASP) capabilities

#### 3. Behavioral Analysis
**Gap**: Limited behavioral analysis for detecting novel attack patterns
**Recommendation**: Machine learning-based anomaly detection

#### 4. Credential Protection
**Gap**: Basic credential security, vulnerable to advanced dumping techniques
