This document provides a detailed gap analysis mapping UNC2891 tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) against current HARDN-XDR security modules to identify coverage gaps and enhancement opportunities.

## Methodology

1. **TTP Identification**: Catalog known UNC2891 attack methods
2. **Control Mapping**: Map existing HARDN-XDR modules to MITRE ATT&CK techniques
3. **Gap Analysis**: Identify techniques with insufficient coverage
4. **Risk Assessment**: Prioritize gaps based on threat impact and likelihood

## Critical Security Gaps

### High-Risk Gaps

#### 1. Process Injection (T1055) - [NONE] No Coverage
**Current State**: No specific protection against process injection techniques
**Risk Impact**: High - Allows malware to hide in legitimate processes
**Recommendation**: Implement runtime process protection module

#### 2. Access Token Manipulation (T1134) - [DETECT] Detection Only
**Current State**: Auditd can log events but cannot prevent
**Risk Impact**: High - Enables privilege escalation
**Recommendation**: Enhanced privilege monitoring and prevention

#### 3. Credential Dumping (T1003.008) - [PARTIAL] Partial Coverage
**Current State**: File permissions protect but sophisticated techniques can bypass
**Risk Impact**: High - Compromise of system credentials
**Recommendation**: Advanced credential protection mechanisms

#### 4. Masquerading (T1036) - [PARTIAL] Partial Coverage
**Current State**: YARA and AIDE provide some detection
**Risk Impact**: High - Evasion of security controls
**Recommendation**: Enhanced behavioral analysis

### Medium-Risk Gaps

#### 5. Kernel Module Persistence (T1547.006) - [PARTIAL] Partial Coverage
**Current State**: Basic kernel hardening and integrity monitoring
**Risk Impact**: High - Persistent root-level access
**Recommendation**: Enhanced boot and kernel integrity verification

#### 6. Network Discovery (T1018) - [PARTIAL] Partial Coverage
**Current State**: UFW blocks most discovery but some techniques remain
**Risk Impact**: Medium - Network reconnaissance
**Recommendation**: Enhanced network segmentation and monitoring

## Conclusion

This gap analysis reveals critical areas where HARDN-XDR can be enhanced to better defend against UNC2891-style attacks. The highest priority should be given to process protection and credential security enhancements, as these address the most critical gaps with the highest risk impact.

Implementation of the recommended modules will significantly improve the security posture against advanced persistent threats while maintaining the system's usability and performance characteristics.
